Beebop is an app that will allow a caregiver or parent to manage their babyâ€™s schedule or task list and adapt when necessary. My mother is a nanny and my sister is expecting her first child. I want to create a way for both a parent and caregiver to properly communicate so that the child's care comes first. Beebop allows you to put your trust in your caregiver while also keeping you on task as a busy parent. 

### Features
- Once you login, you will have the ability to select whether you are a parent or a caregiver.
- A caregiver will sign in and create their profile and await for the parent to connect their account to the caregivers account.
- The parent, once logged in, has the ability to select their caregiver from a list of caregivers.
- The parent can then create tasks for the caregiver to view and check off.
- The parent also has the ability to edit tasks as needed.
- As a caregiver, he or she will be able to view and check off tasks as they are created so that the parent can see when these tasks are completed.
- An unauthenticated user is able to view the homepage and about page
