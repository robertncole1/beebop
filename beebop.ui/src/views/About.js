            <p>Beebop started as a conversation between my mother, who is a full-time nanny and my sister who is expecting her first child. They both stress the importance of the parent/caregiver relationship and how that can shape the development of the child. Beebop takes that relationship very seriously. We are a scheduling app designed to keep your baby on track no matter who is taking care of them. We got you covered.</p>
            <p>Family is at the heart of everything we do and we take child development very seriously. So, beebop allows you to see how your child is being cared for on a daily basis. As a parent, you can create tasks and activites for your child and caregiver to do together! As a caregiver, you can stay on task and keep track of everything you have acomplished today. We know how challenging child care can be. Beebop is here to help!</p>
